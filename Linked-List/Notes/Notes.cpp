// Linked list --

/* 

    Linked list and array both are linear data structure.

    Different problems with arrays --

    1) Insertion in the middle or in the begining is costly.
    2) Deletion from the middle or in the begining is costly.
    3) Implemention of data structure like, Queue, Deque is complex with array.
    4) Impelemention problem like round robin scheduling algorithm is difficult. Where involved insertion, deletion, rotation.
    5) Memory fragmentation, With arrays has to be allocate contiguous memory, But linked list doesn't required it.

    Different problems with linked list --

    1) In linked list required more memory for the pointer to store the address of next node.
    2) Linked list terversal is costly than array.
    3) Direct access not possible in linked list because no indices are there.
    4) Reverse traversing is not possible in singly linked list however in doubly linked list it is possible.

    What is self referential structure?

    => When a structure contain a pointer of type itself those structure are called self referential structure.
